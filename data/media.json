      "description": "A documentary I filmed with CNA (Channel News Asia) for a series called Raising Expectations aired on 17th February 2026.\n\nThe episode I contributed to was called \"Can AI genuinely improve human health and the planet?\". Apparently, they reach 150 million viewers! That is a lot of eyeballs 👀\n\nIn the piece I talk about the research we are doing at the University of Cambridge with the Conservation Evidence project, to try and change the way we find and bring together evidence to take more effective conservation action.\n\nIf you want to watch for yourself, you can do that here!
