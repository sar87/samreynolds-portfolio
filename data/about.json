    "I'm a researcher at the University of Cambridge working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and conservation biology. My work focuses on developing machine learning tools to address pressing ecological challenges, from species monitoring to habitat preservation.",
    "I believe that thoughtful application of AI can transform how we understand and protect the natural world. My research combines computer vision, acoustic monitoring, and predictive modeling to give conservationists better tools for their vital work.",
    "When I'm not training models or writing papers, you'll find me birdwatching in the Fens, cycling around Cambridge, or attempting to grow vegetables in my college garden."
