      "abstract": "Living evidence databases offer a robust and dynamic alternative to static systematic reviews but require a resilient technical infrastructure for continuous evidence processing. This working paper describes the architecture and implementation of a complete, end-to-end pipeline for this purpose, developed initially for the conservation science domain, which ingests and normalizes documents from academic publishers, screens them for relevance using a multi-stage process, and extracts structured data according to a predefined schema. Key features include a hybrid retrieval model, a human-AI collaborative process for refining inclusion criteria from complex protocols, and the integration of an established, statistically-principled stopping rule to ensure efficiency. The system is designed to operate on local infrastructure using self-hosted models. In a baseline evaluation against a prior large-scale manual review, the fully automated pipeline achieved 97% recall.",

In the next decade the Internet will likely grow to a trillion nodes and need protection from threats ranging from floods of fake generative data to AI-driven malware. Growing centralisation has lead to the breakdown of mutualism across the network, with surveillance capitalism now the dominant business model. We take lessons from biological systems towards evolving a more resilient Internet that can integrate adaptation mechanisms into its fabric. We also contribute ideas for how the Internet might incorporate digital immune systems, including how software stacks might mutate to encourage more architectural diversity. We strongly advocate for the Internet to \"re-decentralise\" towards incentivising more mutualistic forms of communication.",

Following a horizon scan methodology with a panel of 27 conservation scientists and artificial intelligence (AI) experts, 21 ideas likely to significantly impact on the success of global biodiversity conservation were identified from a long list of 104. Our 21 issues include novel interpretation of image and audio data, digital twins for ecosystems, improving species distribution models, and AI-powered conservation advisors. We believe that adoption of AI in conservation will lead to beneficial outcomes for conservation effectiveness and improve our understanding of the natural world. However, it is not a panacea, and will not wholly replace established conservation techniques, education, and on-the-ground research.

Evidence syntheses provide key recommendations for conservation decision-makers by assessing and summarising evidence, but are not always easy to access, digest, and use. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present both opportunities and risks in enabling faster and more intuitive systems to access evidence syntheses and databases. Such systems for natural language search and open-ended evidence-based responses are pipelines comprising many components, with the most critical being the LLM used and how evidence is retrieved from the database. We evaluate the performance of ten LLMs across six different database retrieval strategies against human experts in answering synthetic multiple-choice question exams on the effects of conservation interventions using the Conservation Evidence database. LLM performance was comparable with human experts over 45 filtered questions, both in correctly answering them and retrieving the document used to generate them. Across 1867 unfiltered questions, LLM performance demonstrated a level of conservation-specific knowledge, but this varied across topic areas. A hybrid retrieval strategy that combines keywords and vector embeddings performed best by a substantial margin. With careful domain-specific design, LLMs could potentially be powerful tools for enabling expert-level use of evidence syntheses and databases in different disciplines. However, general LLMs used 'out-of-the-box' are likely to perform poorly and misinform decision-makers.",

It aims to include all actions that have been carried out or advised to support populations or communities of wild anguillid eels in inland habitats, whether evidence for the effectiveness of an action is available or not. It includes 114 summarized studies from 88 publications, covering 36 conservation actions out of a possible 126 actions identified with the help of 14 experts. Most of the evidence fell into two main themes: mitigating the effects of migration barriers, which includes the use of fish passes, physically capturing and transporting eels past barriers, modifying the operation of barriers, or removing barriers entirely; and translocating or restocking eels. Beyond these two themes, research was sparse, with only a handful of studies focused on habitat restoration and even fewer addressing overfishing. No evidence was found on climate change mitigation, habitat protection, education and awareness, or the impacts of residential and commercial development on eels.",

However, understanding the influence of parasites is central to understanding the ecosystem services provided by host species, especially in an era of global environmental change. We examined the effect of native (the trematode Rhipidocotyle campanula) and invasive (the bitterling fish Rhodeus amarus) parasites, and their interaction, on the clearance rates of unionid mussels, a dominant ecosystem-engineering group that modify freshwater ecosystems worldwide. We used a combination of field experiments, laboratory experiments and ecological simulations to demonstrate the phenotypic impact of parasites on the functional response of two mussel species across an environmental gradient (suspended particle concentration), and extended this with host and parasite community data to demonstrate the consequences for a real-world ecosystem, the Old West River in Cambridgeshire, England. Both parasites altered the clearance rates of their hosts but in contrasting fashion: while R. campanula increased host clearance rates relative to uninfected conspecifics under all conditions, R. amarus suppressed clearance rates at high suspended particle concentrations (eutrophic conditions) but elevated them otherwise. Overall, the proportion of daily river discharge filtered by the combined mussel community changed by up to 96% in the presence of parasites. Our study demonstrates that parasitism can significantly alter wider ecosystem processes through changing the phenotype of their host.",

      "abstract": "There is growing acknowledgement that human-induced change can push ecosystems beyond tipping points, resulting in the dramatic and sudden loss of vital ecosystem services. Invasive non-native species (INNS) are spreading rapidly due to anthropogenic activities and climate change and can drive changes to ecosystem functioning by altering abiotic conditions and restructuring native communities. Shallow lake ecosystems are especially vulnerable to perturbation from INNS as they can exist in two alternative stable states: either clear water with an abundance of vegetation or turbid, unvegetated and dominated by phytoplankton. Through a global meta-analysis of studies observing the effects of INNS on recipient lake ecosystems, we found that certain INNS drive significant changes in the abundance of key taxa and conditions that govern the balance of alternative equilibria in shallow lakes. Invasive fish and crustaceans demonstrated effects likely to lead to early ecosystem collapse to a turbid state and delay ecosystem recovery. Invasive molluscs presented opposite effects, which may delay ecosystem collapse and encourage ecosystem recovery. Our results demonstrate that INNS could significantly alter the tipping points of ecosystem collapse and recovery, and that not all invasive species may initiate system collapse.",

Quagga mussels were first recorded in the UK in 2014 and have subsequently established at high densities in a number of major reservoirs. Through implementing a Progressive-Change BACIPS (Before-After-Control-Impact Paired Series) analysis, we found that the following trends were observed following quagga mussel establishment: reduced diatom and cyanobacteria abundances; increased soluble reactive phosphorus and reactive silica concentrations; and reduced abundances of Aphanizomenon sp., a potentially toxic cyanobacterium. We also found reservoirs with established quagga mussel populations experienced slightly increased overall chlorophyll a concentration but no changes in turbidity or Microcystis sp. abundance, which are often considered common indicators of dreissenid invasion. Our results show that Progressive-Change BACIPS analysis is a powerful tool which can be used to interrogate industry standard long-term datasets of water quality metrics in order to identify and quantify the impacts of invasive species when the approximate timeframe of species arrival is known.",

These ecosystems exist in a delicate state of balance and are under increasing anthropogenic and climatic pressures. One of the major anthropogenic threats to freshwater ecosystems is eutrophication that often leads to algal blooms, some of which may be extremely harmful. Current chemical and physical interventions to prevent algal blooms can be expensive, ephemeral and disruptive to other aspects of the ecosystem. Therefore, there is interest in utilising biological methods of control. This study aimed to assess the viability of allelopathic repression of nuisance algae species by invasive aquatic plants. The allelopathic effect of Hydrocotyle ranunculoides (Floating Pennywort) and Crassula helmsii (Swamp Stonecrop) were tested in both whole plant and crushed plant states for their ability to affect the average population growth of monocultures and co-cultures of the green algae Chlorella vulgaris and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Although this study explores the possibility of embracing the allelopathic potential of invasive aquatic plants, we do not encourage novel introductions of invasive species into open freshwater systems. However, potential allelopathic effects could be leveraged in already invaded systems, or in closed systems within an invaded range.",
