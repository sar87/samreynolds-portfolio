# Sam Reynolds Academic Website

## What This Is

A modern, polished academic portfolio website showcasing Sam Reynolds' research at the intersection of AI and Conservation. Features dark mode design with Linear-style animations (scroll reveals, gradient text, hover micro-interactions). The game mode from v0.9 is archived for potential future use.

## Core Value

Visitors immediately access Sam's academic work through a visually striking, professional interface that communicates cutting-edge research credibility through modern design.

## Current Milestone: v1.0 Professional Polish

**Goal:** Transform from dual-mode experiment to polished professional website with modern animations

**Target features:**
- Dark mode design throughout
- Linear.app-style scroll reveal animations
- Gradient text effects on headings
- Hover micro-interactions on cards and links
- Updated content synced from samreynolds.org
- Direct website entry (landing page archived)

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Professional website mode with content sections — v0.9
- ✓ Structured JSON data files for content — v0.9
- ✓ Game mode with Pallet Town exploration — v0.9 (archived)

### Active

- [ ] Dark mode color scheme
- [ ] Scroll-triggered reveal animations
- [ ] Gradient text effects on headings
- [ ] Hover micro-interactions (cards lift, glow, color shifts)
- [ ] Content synced from samreynolds.org (publications, talks, media, research, bio)
- [ ] Landing page bypassed — direct to website
- [ ] Game code archived (kept but disabled)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] GitHub Pages deployment tested

### Out of Scope

- Game mode improvements — archived for future milestone
- Touch controls for game — deferred with game mode
- Sprite calibration — deferred with game mode
- Admin interface — use JSON + Claude Code
- Real-time features / backend — static site only
- OAuth or user accounts — informational site only

## Context

**Current codebase state (v0.9):**
- ~8,600 lines of TypeScript/JavaScript/CSS
- Game engine fully built (archiving, not deleting)
- Normal website mode functional but needs design refresh
- JSON content structure in place

**Content to sync (from samreynolds.org):**
- Bio: PhD Zoology Cambridge, focus on AI + Conservation
- 15 publications (2019-2025): Nature, TREE, Global Change Biology, PlosOne
- Media: CIEEM podcast, COP30 video, Wildscreen panel, Cambridge feature
- Research: AI-enabled evidence synthesis, invasive species PhD work

**Design inspiration:**
- linear.app: Scroll reveals, gradient text, subtle hover states
- Dark mode with purposeful, subtle motion

## Constraints

- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static files only)
- **Data format**: JSON files for content
- **Mobile**: Must be responsive
- **Performance**: Smooth animations on modest hardware
- **Accessibility**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Archive game mode for v1.0 | Focus on polished professional presence first | — Pending |
| Dark mode | Modern aesthetic matching AI/tech research focus | — Pending |
| Linear-style animations | Communicates cutting-edge credibility through design | — Pending |
| Keep game code | May revisit in future milestone | — Pending |
| JSON for content | Easy to update via Claude Code | ✓ Good |
