## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Sprite style decision (2026-01-30):** Using LPC/Kenney CC-licensed sprites instead of Pokemon-style to avoid copyright issues - impacts visual aesthetic but ensures legal safety for academic portfolio
- **Node.js version (2026-01-30):** Pinned to v20.19.5 via .nvmrc - Vite 7.x requires ^20.19.0 or >=22.12.0
- **Player sprite (2026-01-30):** Placeholder sprite used - user must generate final blonde/academic character via LPC Character Generator
- **Theatre interpretation (2026-01-30):** Using LPC Tavern decorations as lecture hall assets due to limited theatre sprites in LPC ecosystem

### Pending Todos

- Generate custom player character via Universal LPC Character Generator (blonde hair, academic appearance)
- Update CREDITS.txt with Character Generator exported credits

### Blockers/Concerns

**Resolved:**
- ~~Sprite aesthetic trade-off~~ - Accepted LPC style, assets downloaded
- ~~Specific sprite pack selection~~ - LPC ecosystem selected exclusively
- ~~Attribution pattern for CC-BY assets~~ - Dual-file system established (CREDITS.txt + ATTRIBUTION.md)

**Remaining:**
- Player character sprite needs manual generation via browser tool
- Some building interiors have limited assets (station/theatre) - may need creative interpretation

**Mobile Performance:**
- Research recommends testing mobile performance in early phases (Phase 4-5), not waiting until Phase 8
- Target: 30+ FPS on mid-range Android device (Pixel 6a or equivalent)
