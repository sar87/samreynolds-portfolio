## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Sprite style decision (2026-01-30):** Using LPC/Kenney CC-licensed sprites instead of Pokemon-style to avoid copyright issues - impacts visual aesthetic but ensures legal safety for academic portfolio

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 Critical:**
- Sprite aesthetic trade-off must be resolved: Accept LPC/Kenney style (different from Pokemon FRLG vision) or budget for custom sprites ($500-2000 estimated)
- Specific sprite pack selection needed before implementation begins
- Attribution pattern for CC-BY assets must be established

**Mobile Performance:**
- Research recommends testing mobile performance in early phases (Phase 4-5), not waiting until Phase 8
- Target: 30+ FPS on mid-range Android device (Pixel 6a or equivalent)
