## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Goal | Score | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 10. Architecture Cleanup | Archive game, direct homepage loading | 4/4 | PASSED |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status: EXCELLENT — 23/23 exports connected, 0 orphaned, 0 missing**

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Phase 10 → 11: main.ts imports design CSS | WIRED |
| Phase 11 → 12: animations.css uses design tokens | WIRED |
| Phase 10 → 12: main.ts calls initAnimations() | WIRED |
| Phase 12 → Components: scroll-reveal classes applied | WIRED |
| Phase 13 → Renderers: JSON → content.ts → pages | WIRED |
| Phase 14 → All: responsive CSS integrates with tokens | WIRED |

## E2E Flow Verification

**3/3 flows verified end-to-end.**

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Desktop visit | Load → scroll → reveal → hover → click → detail → back | COMPLETE |
| Mobile visit | Load → hamburger → navigate → touch → detail | COMPLETE |
| Reduced motion | Content immediately visible, feedback preserved | COMPLETE |

## Build Health

- TypeScript: PASSES (no errors)
- Production build: PASSES
- CSS: 31.45 kB (gzipped: 6.04 kB)
- JS: 23.46 kB (gzipped: 7.24 kB)
- Build time: ~273ms

## Tech Debt (Non-blocking)

**4 items across 2 phases:**

### Phase 13: Content Sync
1. JSON schemas for publications/media missing image field (documentation-only, no runtime validation)
2. CONTENT-01 requirement says 15 papers but source has 14 published (1 in prep — not an error)

### Phase 14: Deployment
3. No git remote configured — site not yet pushed to GitHub
4. Deployed site human verification pending (requires GitHub push + Pages enable)

## Anti-Patterns

No anti-patterns detected across any phase. No TODO, FIXME, placeholder, or stub patterns found in source code.

## Design Pivots (Documented)

| Original Plan | Pivoted To | Reason | Approved |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Dark mode | Light theme | User preference | Yes (Phase 11) |
| Halftone texture | Playfair Display serif | User preferred clean editorial look | Yes (Phase 11-04) |
