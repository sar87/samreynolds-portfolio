# Milestone v1.0: Professional Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-15
**Phases:** 10-14
**Total Plans:** 17

## Overview

Transforming the dual-mode academic portfolio into a polished professional website. The journey began by archiving the game mode and removing mode switching, then established a light theme design foundation with Playfair Display typography and accessibility support, added Linear-style animations (scroll reveals, gradient text, hover micro-interactions), synced all content from samreynolds.org, and concluded with mobile responsiveness testing and GitHub Pages deployment verification.

## Milestone Summary

**Design Pivots:**

- Dark mode → Light theme (user preference, Phase 11)
- Halftone texture → Playfair Display serif (user preferred clean editorial look, Phase 11-04)

**Key Decisions:**

- Archive game mode for v1.0 (focus on professional presence first)
- Light theme with blue accent (#0066cc)
- Playfair Display for NYT-style editorial aesthetic
- Linear-style animations (scroll reveals, gradient text, hover micro-interactions)
- 14 papers (not 15) — 15th "in preparation" excluded
- CIEEM podcast uses direct MP3 audio element (not Spotify iframe)
- Base path conditional on GITHUB_PAGES env var

**Issues Resolved:**

- main.ts reduced from 303 to 103 lines (architecture simplification)
- Fabricated talks replaced with 18 real conference presentations
- Education dates corrected (PhD 2021, MSc 2013, BSc 2011)
- DOI made optional in schema for publications without DOI

**Issues Deferred:**

- No git remote configured — site not yet pushed to GitHub
- Deployed site human verification pending (requires GitHub push + Pages enable)

**Technical Debt:**

- JSON schemas missing image field (documentation-only, no runtime impact)
- Repository name 'Website' assumed for base path (may need update if different)
