## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Combat/battle system | Not a game, it's a portfolio - interactions should reveal content, not gameplay |
| Puzzles blocking content | All academic content must be directly accessible |
| User accounts/login | Informational site only, no personalization needed |
| Real-time multiplayer | Static hosting, no server infrastructure |
| Auto-playing music | Common anti-pattern, annoys visitors |
| Backend/database | GitHub Pages constraint - static files only |
| Custom sprite creation | Using CC-licensed LPC/Kenney assets for quality and speed |
| Pokemon-style sprites | Nintendo copyright makes this legally risky for academic portfolio |
