## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- LPC/Kenney sprites over Pokemon style for legal safety (later overridden by user request in Phase 9)
- 32x32 tiles at 2x scale for LPC standard (changed to 16x16 at 3x for Pokemon)
- JSON for content data - easy updates via Claude Code
- Five buildings mapping to content categories
- Dual-mode with landing splash for visitor choice
- Session-only visit tracking (not localStorage)
- Pre-rendered map approach for Pokemon Pallet Town sprites

**Issues Resolved:**

- Vite 7.x Node.js compatibility (pinned to v20.19.5)
- JSON Schema 2020-12 import path (`ajv/dist/2020.js`)
- Vanilla JS / TypeScript integration via CampusGame.ts wrapper

**Issues Deferred:**

- Phase 8 mobile/polish work (touch controls, walk animations)
- Phase 9 sprite calibration (map coordinates, collision zones)
- Custom player character generation via LPC Character Generator

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Sprite calibration incomplete - map rendering offset, collision mismatch
- ~16 requirements unchecked (Phase 8 items)
- Old Cambridge building references in some content display methods
