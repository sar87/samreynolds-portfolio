## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion

User delegated all implementation choices to Claude. The following areas are open for research and planning to determine:

**Panel design:**
- Modal overlay vs sidebar vs in-game window
- Styling approach (game-themed vs website-consistent)
- Animation and transitions

**Interaction triggers:**
- Proximity threshold for activation
- Visual feedback when near interactive objects
- Key binding for interaction (ENTER, SPACE, E, etc.)

**Content display:**
- Amount of content per panel
- Scrolling behavior for long lists
- Links to full details (website mode or external)

**Location HUD:**
- Position and styling of building name indicator
- Always visible vs contextual display
- Transition animations

</decisions>
