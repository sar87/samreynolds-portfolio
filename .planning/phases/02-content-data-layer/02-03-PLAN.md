<objective>
Create media.json with podcast, panel, and video appearances, and about.json with bio, education, and contact links.

Purpose: Complete the personal profile content - media shows public engagement, about provides personal context and contact information.
Output: Two JSON data files for media appearances and about/bio information.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create media.json with all appearances</name>
  <files>data/media.json</files>
  <action>
Create data/media.json containing podcast, panel, video, and interview appearances.

**From PROJECT.md context:**
- CIEEM podcast
- Wildscreen panel
- Cambridge features
- COP30 video

**Structure per media item (from schema):**
```json
{
  "id": "unique-slug-id",
  "type": "podcast",  // or: video, panel, interview
  "title": "Appearance Title",
  "venue": "Outlet/Organization Name",
  "date": "2024-06-15",
  "link": "https://...",  // optional
  "description": "Brief description"  // optional
}
```

**Key decisions from CONTEXT.md:**
- Categorize by format: podcast, video, panel, interview as separate types
- Use metadata from existing content.json.js as base
- Generic icons for media types (handled in UI layer, not here)

**Source:** Expand from existing 5 entries in content.json.js media array.
Include at least:
- 1-2 podcast appearances
- 1-2 video appearances
- 1-2 panel discussions
- 1-2 interviews

Create realistic entries matching research areas and known venues (CIEEM, Wildscreen, COP30, Cambridge).
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
node -e "const m = require('./data/media.json'); const types = [...new Set(m.media.map(x => x.type))]; console.log('Count:', m.media.length, 'Types:', types.sort().join(', '))"
```
Should show count >= 5 and types including at least: interview, panel, podcast, video
  </verify>
  <done>
- media.json contains media appearances
- Each item has required fields (id, type, title, venue, date)
- Type is one of: podcast, video, panel, interview
- Dates are ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Multiple media types represented
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create about.json with bio and education</name>
  <files>data/about.json</files>
  <action>
Create data/about.json containing biographical information, education, and contact links.

**From PROJECT.md context:**
- PhD Cambridge (invasive species)
- MSc/BSc Warwick
- Focus on AI + conservation
- Email: sar87@cam.ac.uk (from website)
- Links: ResearchGate, LinkedIn

**Structure (from schema):**
```json

  }
}
```

**Source:** Use existing content.json.js about section as base, enhance with education array structure.

**Key decisions from CONTEXT.md:**
- Bio as array of paragraphs (for flexible rendering)
- Education includes degree, institution, year
- Links object with social/academic profiles
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
node -e "const a = require('./data/about.json'); console.log('Name:', a.name, 'Bio paras:', a.bio.length, 'Education:', a.education.length)"
```
Should show: Name: Sam Reynolds, Bio paras: >= 2, Education: >= 2
  </verify>
  <done>
- about.json contains complete profile
- Required fields: name, title, affiliation, email, bio (array), education (array)
- Education entries have degree, institution, year
- Links object contains profile URLs
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. media.json parses as valid JSON
2. about.json parses as valid JSON
3. Media types include at least 3 different categories
4. About has education array with degree details
5. All dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- data/media.json exists with media appearances
- data/about.json exists with complete profile
- All required fields present per schemas
- Multiple media types represented (podcast, video, panel, interview)
- Education history structured with degrees
</success_criteria>
