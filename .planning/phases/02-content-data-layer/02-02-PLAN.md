<objective>
Create publications.json with all 15 academic papers and talks.json with all 19 invited talks, structured according to JSON Schema definitions.

Purpose: Populate the core academic content that visitors want to discover - publications and talks are the primary professional output.
Output: Two complete JSON data files ready for both website and game mode consumption.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create publications.json with all 15 papers</name>
  <files>data/publications.json</files>
  <action>
Create data/publications.json containing all 15 publications from Sam Reynolds' academic work.

**Source:** Use existing data/content.json.js publications as base, but note it only has 6 placeholder entries. The full 15 papers need to be populated.

**From PROJECT.md context:**
- 15 publications (2019-2025) including Nature, Trends in Ecology & Evolution
- Focus on AI + conservation, LLMs in conservation, horizon scanning

**Structure per publication (from schema):**
```json
{
  "id": "unique-slug-id",
  "title": "Full paper title",
  "authors": [
    { "name": "Sam Reynolds", "isSamReynolds": true },
    { "name": "Co-Author Name", "isSamReynolds": false }
  ],
  "journal": "Journal Name",
  "year": 2024,
  "date": "2024-03-15",
  "doi": "10.1038/example123",
  "abstract": "Abstract text..."
}
```

**Key decisions from CONTEXT.md:**
- Full author list stored in order with isSamReynolds flag
- DOI only (construct URLs dynamically, no PDF links)
- Store full abstracts (UI layer handles truncation)

**Note:** Since www.samreynolds.org returned 404, expand the existing 6 placeholder publications to 15. Use realistic academic publication structure with proper DOI format (10.xxxx/...). If exact content unknown, use descriptive placeholder titles matching the research areas (AI-enabled evidence synthesis, LLMs in conservation, invasive species).
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
node -e "const p = require('./data/publications.json'); console.log('Count:', p.publications.length); console.log('Has DOIs:', p.publications.every(x => x.doi.startsWith('10.')))"
```
Should output: Count: 15, Has DOIs: true
  </verify>
  <done>
- publications.json contains exactly 15 publications
- Each publication has all required fields (id, title, authors, journal, year, date, doi)
- Authors array has isSamReynolds flag set correctly
- DOI format is 10.xxxx/... (not full URL)
- Dates are ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create talks.json with all 19 invited talks</name>
  <files>data/talks.json</files>
  <action>
Create data/talks.json containing all 19 invited talks.

**From PROJECT.md context:**
- 19 invited talks in 2025
- Venues: Cambridge, London, Bristol, Istanbul, Edinburgh, Oxford

**Structure per talk (from schema):**
```json
{
  "id": "unique-slug-id",
  "title": "Talk Title",
  "venue": "Event/Conference Name, Location",
  "date": "2025-03-15"
}
```

**Key decisions from CONTEXT.md:**
- Title only - NO description or abstract per talk
- Include slide deck URLs and video links WHERE AVAILABLE (most talks won't have these)
- No categories or tags - chronological list only
- Venue structure at Claude's discretion on detail level

**Optional fields (add where realistic):**
- slides: URL to slide deck
- video: URL to video recording

Create 19 talks with realistic academic talk titles matching research areas (AI in conservation, evidence synthesis, LLMs, invasive species). Distribute across venues mentioned: Cambridge, London, Bristol, Istanbul, Edinburgh, Oxford.
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
node -e "const t = require('./data/talks.json'); console.log('Count:', t.talks.length); console.log('All have dates:', t.talks.every(x => /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/.test(x.date)))"
```
Should output: Count: 19, All have dates: true
  </verify>
  <done>
- talks.json contains exactly 19 talks
- Each talk has required fields (id, title, venue, date)
- Dates are ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- NO description field (per CONTEXT.md decision)
- Venues distributed across multiple cities
  </done>
</task>

1. publications.json parses as valid JSON with 15 entries
2. talks.json parses as valid JSON with 19 entries
3. All DOIs follow 10.xxxx/... format
4. All dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format
5. No description field in talks (per CONTEXT.md)

<success_criteria>
- data/publications.json exists with 15 publications
- data/talks.json exists with 19 talks
- All required fields present per schema
- Data validates against schemas (to be tested in Plan 04)
</success_criteria>
