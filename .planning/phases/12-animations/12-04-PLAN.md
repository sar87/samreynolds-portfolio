<objective>
Visual verification checkpoint: User confirms all animations meet quality standards and feel right.

Purpose: Animations are subjective. While code can be tested, the "feel" of motion design requires human judgment. This checkpoint ensures animations are smooth, not jarring, and match the Linear.app aesthetic requested.

Output: User approval or specific feedback for adjustments.

  <name>Task 1: Visual animation quality verification</name>
  <what-built>
Complete animation system for Phase 12:

**Scroll Reveals:**
- Sections fade and slide into view (alternating left/right direction)
- Cards animate in with staggered timing (50ms delay between each)
- One-time animation (sections don't re-animate on scroll back)

**Gradient Text:**
- Hero heading (name) has animated gradient
- All section headings (About, Research, Publications, etc.) have animated gradient
- Gradient cycles slowly (5 seconds) - ambient, not attention-grabbing
- Colors: charcoal/dark gray to brand blue (#0066cc) and back

**Hover Interactions:**
- Cards: lift -6px with enhanced shadow (shadow-lg)
- Links: color shift with animated underline sweeping in
- Snappy timing: 150-200ms transitions

**Accessibility:**
- All animations disabled for prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
- Content immediately visible without animation for reduced-motion users
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server if not running: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173 in browser

**Test scroll reveals:**
- Refresh page and scroll slowly down
- Sections should fade/slide in as they enter viewport
- Check if alternating direction feels natural or distracting
- Cards in grids should animate with stagger (one after another)

**Test gradient text:**
- Look at "Sam Reynolds" hero heading
- Look at section headings (About, Research, Publications, etc.)
- Gradient should slowly shift colors (charcoal -> blue -> charcoal)
- Animation should feel ambient, not distracting

**Test hover interactions:**
- Hover over publication cards - should lift visibly with shadow
- Hover over About section links - underline should sweep in
- Hover over header nav links - same underline effect
- All interactions should feel snappy (not sluggish)

**Test reduced motion:**
- Open DevTools > Rendering > Emulate CSS media prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
- Refresh page
- All content should be immediately visible (no animations)
- Hover effects should be instant or disabled

**Performance check:**
- Open DevTools > Performance tab
- Record while scrolling through page
- Check for consistent 60fps (no red bars indicating dropped frames)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type one of:
- "approved" - animations look great, proceed to complete phase
- Describe specific issues (e.g., "cards lift too much", "gradient too fast", "stagger feels slow")
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>
