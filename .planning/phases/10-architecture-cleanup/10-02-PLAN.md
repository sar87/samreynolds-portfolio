<objective>
Move all game-related code to the `_archived/` directory, preserving it for potential future reuse while removing it from the active codebase.

Purpose: Clean separation of archived game code from the professional website. The underscore prefix signals "excluded" and placing at root means automatic exclusion from tsconfig's `include: ["src"]`.

Output: `_archived/` directory with organized game code and restoration documentation.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create archive directory structure and move files</name>
  <files>_archived/</files>
  <action>
Create the `_archived/` directory at project root and move all game-related code:

**Create directory structure:**
```bash
mkdir -p _archived/src-game
mkdir -p _archived/src-landing
mkdir -p _archived/src-styles
mkdir -p _archived/js-game
mkdir -p _archived/data-game
mkdir -p _archived/assets-sprites
```

**Move files (use mv, not cp):**

1. **TypeScript game engine:**
   ```bash
   mv src/game/* _archived/src-game/
   rmdir src/game
   ```
   This includes: CampusGame.ts, Game.ts, core/, data/, entities/, rendering/, systems/

2. **Landing page component:**
   ```bash
   mv src/components/Landing/* _archived/src-landing/
   rmdir src/components/Landing
   ```
   This includes: Landing.ts, Landing.css, GamePreview.ts, LoadingScreen.ts, LoadingScreen.css

3. **Game styles:**
   ```bash
   mv src/styles/game.css _archived/src-styles/game.css
   ```

4. **Vanilla JS game scripts:**
   ```bash
   mv js/game/* _archived/js-game/
   rmdir js/game
   ```
   This includes: sprites.js, player.js, world.js, buildings.js, engine.js

5. **Game content data:**
   ```bash
   mv data/content.json.js _archived/data-game/content.json.js
   ```

6. **Sprite assets:**
   ```bash
   mv assets/sprites/* _archived/assets-sprites/
   rmdir assets/sprites
   ```
   This includes: buildings/, characters/, objects/, terrain/

**Verify moves completed:**
- `src/game/` should not exist
- `src/components/Landing/` should not exist
- `js/game/` should not exist
- `assets/sprites/` should not exist
- All content now in `_archived/`
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `ls _archived/` shows: src-game, src-landing, src-styles, js-game, data-game, assets-sprites
2. `ls src/game 2>/dev/null` returns error (directory doesn't exist)
3. `ls src/components/Landing 2>/dev/null` returns error
4. `ls js/game 2>/dev/null` returns error
5. `ls assets/sprites 2>/dev/null` returns error
6. `npm run build` still succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>
- All game files moved to _archived/
- Original directories removed
- Build still works (no broken imports since 10-01 removed them)
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create archive documentation</name>
  <files>_archived/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create a README.md in the _archived/ directory documenting:

1. **What was archived:** The pixel-art game mode from v0.9
2. **When:** Current date (2026-02-02)
3. **Why:** Focus on professional polish for v1.0
4. **Contents:** List of each subdirectory and what it contains
5. **Restoration instructions:** Step-by-step guide to restore game mode

**README content should include:**

```markdown
# Archived Game Mode

This directory contains the pixel-art campus game mode from v0.9.
Archived on 2026-02-02 as part of v1.0 Professional Polish milestone.

## Why Archived

v1.0 focuses on a polished professional academic website. The game mode
is preserved here for potential future reuse but is not part of the
current site experience.

## Contents

| Directory | Original Location | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| src-game/ | src/game/ | TypeScript game engine (CampusGame, Game, core, entities, rendering, systems) |
| src-landing/ | src/components/Landing/ | Landing page with mode selection |
| src-styles/ | src/styles/game.css | Game-specific CSS styles |
| js-game/ | js/game/ | Vanilla JS game scripts (sprites, player, world, buildings, engine) |
| data-game/ | data/content.json.js | Game content and building data |
| assets-sprites/ | assets/sprites/ | Sprite sheets (buildings, characters, objects, terrain) |

## To Restore Game Mode

1. Move directories back to original locations:
   ```bash
   mv _archived/src-game/* src/game/
   mv _archived/src-landing/* src/components/Landing/
   mv _archived/src-styles/game.css src/styles/
   mv _archived/js-game/* js/game/
   mv _archived/data-game/content.json.js data/
   mv _archived/assets-sprites/* assets/sprites/
   ```

2. Restore imports in main.ts:
   - Add game/landing CSS imports
   - Import CampusGame, Landing components, LoadingScreen
   - Restore mode switching logic and event handlers
   - Add /game route

3. Restore Header modeToggle:
   - Add GAME_ICON constant
   - Add modeToggle button to renderHeader()
   - Add initModeToggle() function
   - Add modeToggle CSS styles

4. Test: `npm run dev` and verify game mode works

## Original Functionality

- Landing page with website/game choice
- Keyboard shortcut (G key) to toggle modes
- Header "Play Game" button
- Pixel-art campus exploration game
- Building interactions and NPC dialogues
```
  </action>
  <verify>
1. `cat _archived/README.md` shows complete documentation
2. README includes restoration instructions
3. README lists all archived directories
4. README has accurate date and context
  </verify>
  <done>
- README.md created with full documentation
- Restoration instructions are complete and accurate
- Future developers can understand and restore if needed
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After completing all tasks:

1. **Archive structure:** `ls -la _archived/` shows 7 items (README + 6 directories)
2. **Original locations clean:**
   - `test ! -d src/game && echo "clean"`
   - `test ! -d src/components/Landing && echo "clean"`
   - `test ! -d js/game && echo "clean"`
   - `test ! -d assets/sprites && echo "clean"`
3. **Build check:** `npm run build` succeeds
4. **Runtime check:** `npm run dev` - site works as expected
5. **No broken references:** `grep -r "src/game\|components/Landing" src/ 2>/dev/null` returns nothing
