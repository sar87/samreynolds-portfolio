<objective>
Verify the complete design foundation visually and functionally.

Purpose: Design work requires human verification - colors, texture intensity, and overall aesthetic need visual confirmation before moving to Phase 12 (Animations).
Output: Confirmed design ready for animation phase.

  <name>Task 1: Build and start dev server</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run production build to catch any errors, then start dev server:

```bash
cd /home/sam/Documents/Website
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Verify build completes without errors and dev server starts.

  <what-built>
Complete light theme design foundation:
- Off-white background (#fafafa)
- Blue accent color (#0066cc)
- Halftone dot texture overlay
- Card shadow elevation
- Header with subtle shadow
- Reduced motion support
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open http://localhost:5173 in browser
2. Check overall appearance:
   - Background is off-white (not pure white)
   - Text is dark and readable
   - Links are blue (#0066cc)
   - Halftone dot texture is visible (subtle newspaper feel)

3. Test interactivity:
   - Click nav links - they should work (texture not blocking)
   - Click on a publication/talk/media card - should navigate
   - Hover over cards - shadow should increase, slight lift

4. Check card styling:
   - Cards have subtle shadow at rest
   - Hover shows increased shadow
   - Border changes to blue on hover

5. Test reduced motion (in DevTools):
   - Open DevTools > Rendering > Emulate CSS media feature
   - Set prefers-reduced-motion to "reduce"
   - Hover over cards - shadow changes but NO movement
   - Scroll - should be instant, not smooth

6. Contrast check:
   - Body text readable against background
   - Links distinguishable
   - Card text readable

If texture is too strong or too subtle, note the adjustment needed.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if design looks good, or describe issues:
- "texture too strong" - we'll reduce --texture-opacity
- "texture too subtle" - we'll increase --texture-opacity
- "shadows too harsh" - we'll adjust shadow tokens
- "colors off" - describe what's wrong
  </resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Apply any adjustments from verification</name>
  <files>src/styles/variables.css</files>
  <action>
Based on checkpoint feedback, make adjustments:

If texture too strong:
- Reduce --texture-opacity from 0.12 to 0.08 or 0.06

If texture too subtle:
- Increase --texture-opacity from 0.12 to 0.15 or 0.18

If shadows too harsh:
- Reduce opacity values in shadow tokens (e.g., 0.04 to 0.03)

If colors need adjustment:
- Update the specific color token mentioned

If everything approved with no changes needed, skip this task.
  </action>
  <verify>If changes made, verify by refreshing browser</verify>
  <done>Design adjustments applied (or none needed)</done>

1. Human confirms visual design meets expectations
2. All interactive elements functional
3. Reduced motion properly disables transitions
4. Build remains clean after any adjustments

<success_criteria>
- User approves overall visual design
- Halftone texture intensity is appropriate
- Card elevation and hover effects work correctly
- Accessibility (contrast, reduced motion) verified
