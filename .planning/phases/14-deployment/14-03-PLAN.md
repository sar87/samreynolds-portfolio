<objective>
Visual verification of mobile responsiveness and deployment readiness.

Purpose: Plans 01 and 02 make CSS changes and deployment configuration that need visual verification. This checkpoint pauses for the user to confirm the mobile layout looks correct, touch targets feel adequate, and the production build serves properly. This is the final verification before the site ships.

Output: User approval or issue list for iteration.

  <name>Task 1: Automated responsive verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Before the visual checkpoint, run automated checks to catch obvious issues:

1. Run `npm run build` to verify clean build
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Using the browser console (via DevTools), check at 320px viewport:
   - `document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= document.documentElement.clientWidth` (no horizontal overflow)
4. Verify touch target sizing by inspecting computed styles of key elements:
   - Hamburger menu button: min-height >= 44px
   - Mobile nav links: min-height >= 44px
   - Card elements: have adequate padding
   - Detail page links: min-height >= 44px
5. Verify fluid typography by comparing font sizes at 320px vs 1200px:
   - Body text should be ~16px at 320px, ~18px at 1200px
   - Section headings should be ~36px at 320px, ~48px at 1200px
  </action>
  <verify>
All automated checks pass. No horizontal overflow detected. Touch targets meet minimum sizes.
  </verify>
  <done>
Automated verification confirms no horizontal overflow, correct touch target sizes, and fluid typography scaling.
  </done>

  <what-built>
Mobile-responsive CSS (fluid typography, touch targets, progressive breakpoints at 480px/640px/768px) and GitHub Pages deployment configuration (vite.config.ts base path, GitHub Actions workflow).
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server with `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

**Mobile layout verification (use browser DevTools responsive mode):**

1. **320px width** (minimum mobile):
   - [ ] No horizontal scrollbar
   - [ ] Text is readable (not too large, not too small)
   - [ ] Card grid shows single column
   - [ ] Hero fills viewport, text is visible
   - [ ] Showcase cards stack vertically and fit
   - [ ] Video banners are visible and proportionate
   - [ ] Hamburger menu opens and links are tappable

2. **375px width** (iPhone SE):
   - [ ] Comfortable spacing, no cramping
   - [ ] About section grid is single column

3. **768px width** (tablet):
   - [ ] Desktop navigation appears
   - [ ] Card grid shows 2 columns
   - [ ] About grid shows sidebar on right

4. **1024px+ width** (desktop):
   - [ ] Full desktop layout unchanged from before
   - [ ] Card grid shows 3 columns
   - [ ] Showcase cards have 3D perspective tilt

5. **Production build test:**
   - Run `npm run build && npm run preview`
   - Open http://localhost:4173
   - [ ] Site loads and functions correctly

**Optional: Test on your phone**
If you can access the dev server from your phone (same network), test real touch interaction.

  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the mobile layout looks good, or describe any issues to fix.</resume-signal>
