  <what-built>
Complete Cambridge campus map with 5 explorable building interiors:
- Campus: Central quad layout, entrance gate spawn, decorations (benches, lampposts, flowers), tree boundaries
- Pembroke College: Personal office with desk, computer, bookshelves (About content)
- University Library: Grand academic space with extensive bookshelves (Publications)
- Research Lab: Zoology theme with specimens, nature imagery, computers (Research)
- TV Station: Broadcast studio with control desk, microphones, screens (Media)
- Lecture Theatre: Stage with curtain, podium, seating (Talks)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start game: `npm run dev` then navigate to /game or press G
2. Verify campus spawn: Player appears at bottom near entrance gate (not middle)
3. Check campus layout:
   - No river/water on left side
   - Central grassy quad with crossing paths
   - Trees around edges creating natural boundary
   - Decorations visible (benches, lampposts, flowers)

4. Verify 5 buildings visible:
   - Pembroke (left side) - traditional gothic style
   - Library (top center) - largest building, traditional
   - Lab (right side) - modern style (distinct from others)
   - Station (right side, below Lab) - traditional
   - Theatre (bottom left) - traditional
   - Each has visible sign near entrance

5. Navigation timing: Walk from spawn to furthest building
   - Should take less than 30 seconds
   - Buildings clustered, not spread far apart

6. Test each building entry/exit:
   a. Walk to Pembroke, press ENTER on door
      - Verify: Personal office interior, desk visible, welcome message
      - Exit: Press ENTER on exit, return to campus
   b. Walk to Library, press ENTER
      - Verify: Grand library, extensive bookshelves, feels impressive
      - Exit: Returns to campus
   c. Walk to Lab, press ENTER
      - Verify: Zoology theme, specimens, computers, nature imagery
      - Exit: Returns to campus
   d. Walk to Station, press ENTER
      - Verify: Broadcast studio setup, mics/screens
      - Exit: Returns to campus
   e. Walk to Theatre, press ENTER
      - Verify: Stage with curtain, podium, seating rows
      - Exit: Returns to campus

7. Check collision:
   - Cannot walk through building walls
   - Cannot walk through trees
   - Can walk on paths and grass
   - Doors are passable

8. Overall aesthetic check:
   - Traditional buildings look gothic/ornate
   - Lab looks modern/clean
   - Interiors match their themes literally
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Human verification covers all Phase 5 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. Campus map includes paths, grass, trees (no water - changed per CONTEXT) with cohesive aesthetic
2. Player can walk to and enter all five buildings
3. Each building has distinct exterior design
4. Building interiors themed to content
5. Player can exit buildings to return to campus
6. Navigation between buildings takes less than 30 seconds
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Human confirms:
- Campus layout matches CONTEXT.md decisions
- All 5 buildings accessible with distinct styles
- Each interior matches its content theme
- Entry/exit works smoothly for all buildings
- Navigation timing is appropriate
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-campus-buildings/05-06-SUMMARY.md`
