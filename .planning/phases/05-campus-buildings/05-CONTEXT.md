# Phase 5: Campus & Buildings - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Complete Cambridge campus map with five explorable building interiors. Players walk around campus, enter buildings (Pembroke, Library, Lab, TV Station, Theatre), and experience distinct themed interiors. Map design, navigation, and building layouts are in scope. Interactive objects that display content are Phase 6.

## Implementation Decisions

### Campus Layout
- No River Cam — skip the river, focus on buildings and paths
- Buildings clustered around a central quad for compact, easy navigation
- Player starts at an entrance/gate — "arrives" on campus for narrative feel
- Fill spaces with details: benches, flowers, lampposts — lived-in feel

### Building Exteriors
- Visible signs/labels on each building showing names
- Vary building sizes to indicate importance (Library larger, etc.)
- Mix of old and modern: only Lab is modern, rest are traditional
- Traditional buildings: detailed and ornate with gothic elements (arched windows, spires, decorative stonework) plus greenery (ivy, plants on walls)

### Interior Theming
- Very literal interpretation — Library = bookshelves, Lab = equipment, etc.
- Single room per building — one main space, simpler navigation
- Pembroke College: special treatment with personal details (desk, personal items)
  - Contains About/bio + research interests
- Library: grand academic feel — tall shelves, impressive, Cambridge library vibes
- Lab: zoology theme mixed with modern computers
  - Animal specimens/displays (taxidermy, specimens in jars)
  - Nature imagery (plants, animal pictures)
  - Computer/tech equipment
- TV Station & Theatre: use tavern/inn LPC assets creatively

### Map Scale & Pacing
- 15-20 seconds to walk across full campus — medium size
- Moderate spacing (5-8 tiles) between buildings — room for decorations
- Both defined paths AND open grass — paths exist but you can walk anywhere
- Natural boundary at edges — fade to trees/nature, organic feel

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact tile counts and map dimensions
- Specific decoration placement
- Building door positions
- Interior furniture arrangement
- How to repurpose tavern assets for station/theatre

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Traditional buildings should look "detailed and ornate" — not plain stone boxes
- Lab reflects actual research: zoology meets computer science
- Pembroke as "home" should feel personal, not generic
